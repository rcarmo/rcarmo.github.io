## About
Makefile wrapping Azure Bicep. make deploy provisions an NC-series GPU spot VM and installs AUTOMATIC1111. make open opens an SSH tunnel. make destroy tears it down. Spot pricing keeps costs under $0.10/hour.

## How it works
make deploy runs a Bicep template that provisions a resource group, data disk, and GPU spot VM, then runs cloud-init to install CUDA and AUTOMATIC1111. Models live on an attached data disk that survives spot preemptions and teardowns. make destroy cleans up everything except the data disk configuration.

## Features

make deploy, make open, make destroy. Under 10 minutes total.

### 💰 Spot pricing
NC6s_v3: typically under $0.10/hour.

### 💾 Persistent models
