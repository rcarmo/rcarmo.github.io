tagline: Browser-based RDP client — full MS-RDPBCGR spec, Go backend, WASM frontend.
---

## About
go-rdp connects to Windows VMs via RDP from any browser without a native client. Go backend implementing the full MS-RDPBCGR specification as a reference implementation; WASM frontend for rendering.

## How it works
The Go backend handles RDP security negotiation, capability exchange, and display updates, streaming JPEG-encoded frames to the browser over WebSocket. Keyboard and mouse events are forwarded as RDP input PDUs. TinyGo compiles the frontend renderer to WASM.

## Features
### 🌐 No native client
RDP in a browser canvas via WebAssembly.

### 📋 Full spec
MS-RDPBCGR reference implementation.

### ⚙ Go + WASM
Docker image for one-command deployment.
