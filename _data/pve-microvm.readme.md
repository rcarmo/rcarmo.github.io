# pve-microvm

</p>

A Debian package that adds QEMU `microvm` machine type support to Proxmox VE.

> **⚠️ Highly experimental.** This project patches `qemu-server` internals and
> has not been tested in production. Use at your own risk. The patches are
> fully reversible — uninstalling the package restores the original files.

## Motivation

We needed something between LXC containers and full QEMU VMs for running
coding agents and other semi-trusted workloads.

| | LXC | microvm | Standard VM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Isolation | Namespace (shared kernel) | **KVM (own kernel)** | KVM (own kernel) |
| Boot time | ~50 ms | **< 200 ms** | 2–10 s |
| Overhead | Minimal | **Minimal** | Moderate |
| Attack surface | Broad (host kernel) | **Minimal (virtio-mmio)** | Broad (emulated PC) |
| Untrusted code | ⚠️ risky | **✅ safe** | ✅ safe |

**Hardware-isolated VMs with container-like speed**, managed through the same
Proxmox tools you already use. No new runtime — QEMU's `microvm` machine type
is already on every PVE node. This package just unlocks it.

## Prior art

As of April 2026, **nobody has done this** — no Proxmox patches, packages,
or integrations exist for the QEMU microvm machine type.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Install
dpkg -i pve-microvm_0.1.4-1_all.deb

# Create a template from debian:trixie-slim (28 MB)
pve-microvm-template

# Clone and boot
qm clone 9000 901 --name my-sandbox --full
qm start 901
qm terminal 901

root@microvm:~#
```

Or manually:

```bash
qm create 900 --machine microvm --memory 256 --cores 1 \
  --name my-microvm --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0 \
  --serial0 socket --vga serial0

pve-oci-import --image alpine:latest --vmid 900 --configure

qm start 900
qm terminal 900
```
